## About React

- Created & Maintained by Facebook (Why it is a reliable choice).

- An open source library for building user interfaces (Not a framework like Angular)

- You can create html elements and embed expressions by using a JavaScript exstension called [_JSX_](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). It similar to a templating engine but you can write the JSX directly in your JavaScript file when using the React library.

- All elements render to the [_Virtual DOM_](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) instead of the standard DOM (ReactDOM).
